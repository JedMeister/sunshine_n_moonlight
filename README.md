# sunshine_n_moonlight

This is a bit of a grab bag of bits and pieces that I found/developed to
assist me to set up and use Sunshine server and Moonlight client (game
compatable remote desktop access).

It is split into a server section and a client section. As may be obvious,
the server section is for your Sunshine server, the client section is for
your Moonlight client.

I'm using Debian on both ends, but should be relevant to other Linux distros.
